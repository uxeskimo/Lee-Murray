<h1>Layout &#10084;</h1>

<p>When you use grids imaginatively, they do much, much more than align content. A grid brings cohesion to a composition. It helps people understand the stories you&#8217;re telling by suggesting hierarchies. Grids inform people what to read first, then next, and how much attention to give it. A thoughtfully chosen grid leads to a wealth of possibilities and any number of exciting designs.</p>
