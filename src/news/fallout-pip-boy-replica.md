I was first introduced to the fallout series playing Fallout 3, the game was a classic,  the post apocalyptic world gripped my imagination, I was hooked.

Anyone that knows about fallout, will know about the pip boy, the (explain what pip boy is)

And now you can own your very own pip boy


The die cast replica is based on the new fallout tv series that is exclusively going to be shown on Amazon prime from the 16th April free for all prime customers.

This replica looks an improvement over the pip boy that came with the Fallout 4 game limited edition release.
