Today Evercade announced a new type of cartridge, the Giga Cart, which has been created to hold bigger and more modern retro games with its larger capacity.

We've got the evercade XP and both Super Pockets which we think are great, the new Giga Cart is the same build and shape as the exsting cartridges so will work with the current evercade devices.

## Bigger and more modern Retro Games
Evercade have mentioed the new catridge has been released for more modern Retro Games that most we're realeased on CD, which we think is promosing.

Whats more the Giga Carts will be priced at £22.49, which seems fair conisdering the extra storage and not much of an increase from the £17.99 of the normal catridges.

## Two Giga Carts coming in 2024
More good news is we will have two Giga Cart relases in 2024, so we we will keep our eyes peeled for what game collection will come with the initial relases.

For more info on Giga Carts, have a look on the [Evercade website](https://evercade.co.uk/introducing-giga-cart/).
