Arcades are a massive part of gaming history and one of the reasons I set up Retro Delights so we could write about them to help contribute to a golden era not being forgotton.

In this list we look at what we think out the top 10 greatest arcade games of all time, this was hard, so much that we nearly changed it to a top 20!



## 10. Paperboy 

![Alt text](/img/Arcade-top-10-paperboy.png "a title")

Paperboy was a bit different, well for starters it had a bike handlebar with grips as a controller, in the game you we're a paperboy who had to deliver newspaers to cutomers while while avoiding the dangers on the streets.

Released by Atari games in April 1985 you would have to throw the papers to a customers door or mailbox, if you didnt you would lose customers or gain them if you delivered the correct amount. 

## 9. Dragons Liar

June 19th 1983 was the exact date Dragons Liar became known to the word as the first full animation laser disc video game.

Controlling our hero Dirk the Daring to try and rescue Princess Daphne from an evil wizard, which inolved pulling off the right move at the right time to complete each sequence in the game.

The game required 200 correct moves to complete which was no mean feat, it could be frustrating, which ultimately added to the reward if you did manage to complete the game.

## 8. Tron

Tron was released as an arcade in the same year as the film in 1982 and was produced by Bally Midway in a deal with Disney and sold over 20,000 cabinets.

You could choose from four digital areans which we're based from the film, Battle Tanks, Light Cycles, I/O Tower and MCP Cone, if you completed all four, you would go again and it would get more difficult each time.

The cabinet had an iconic look and feel, with its backlights and translucent blue joystick, in a dark arcade it really stood out and added to its appeal.


## 7. Donkey Kong

The first game in the Donky Kong series and released in 1981 by Nintendo, Donky Kong was also one of the first games in the platform genre itself.

Donkey knong is actually the villain in the game and has kidnapped the gilfriend of none other than a now well known plumber appearing in his first game, Mario.

The game had four different stages and Mario would make his way climbing up ladders whilst avoiding or destroying obsticles with his hammer, getting to the top of the platform then moving on to the next stage.



## 6. Star Wars

The Star wars arcade give you the oppotunity to reenact Luke Skywalker and the death start trench run, as a kid this was a big deal.

Star wars a new hope was released 1977, the arcade didnt follow until 1983, the same year as Return of the Jedi, it had 3D vecotr graphics and speech samples from the film which created a real feel of the film.

## 5. Gauntlet

Gauntlet was released in 1986 by Atari games, inspired by the Dungeons and Dragons board game, you could have up to four players taking the role of Thor the warrior, Merlin the wizard, Thyra the valkyrie or Questor the elf.

The game played like a shoot em up within a series of mazes, you had to find the exit to each level whilst avoiding/killing the enemies on each maze. 



## 4. Bubble Bobble

Bubble Bobble was released by Taito in 1986 with two players being able to take control of the dinasaurs Bub and Bob to help them find their kidnappped girlfriends in a charming platform game where you would fire bubbles at the enemies and then burst them on each level to progress.

Accompaied by one of the catchiest sound scores to grace a game, Bubble Bobble was a big hit and went on to have to have many sequels and many platforms. 

## 3. Outrun

Released in 1986 by Sega as a stand up and sit down cabinets, Outrun oozed cool and set the standard for driving games.

Driving a Ferrari Testarossa convertible with your gilfriend by your side along the coast with some of the best musical scores to be heard on an arcade, Outrun was a joy to play and still is.

## 2. Pacman

![Alt text](/img/Arcade-top-10-pacman.png "a title")

You cant mention arcade without Pacman coming up, the game was released first in Japan July 1980 and was licensed to the Midway Manuafatoring compnay in the United and released a few monthls later in October 1980 in the United States and world wide soon after.

Pacman become more than a video game, it became an Icon, designed in the Japanese style Kawaii which some would say is cute, [Toru Iwatani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toru_Iwatani) who directed the game wanted it to appeal to women as well as men.

Iconic grpahics, iconice sounds and simple addicitve gameplay, control pacman in a maze with the objective to eat all the pills to progress to the next level. In the process you must avoid the ghosts that accompnay each maze, with the caveat that if Pacman eats one of the four power pellets on each stage the ghosts will temporaily flash and Pacman can eat them (if you can catch them that is).

## 1. Space Invaders

This games needs no introduction, created by [Tomohiro Nishikado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomohiro_Nishikado) and released in Japan June 1978 by Taito and worlwide a few monthls later in October 1978.

The aim of the game, controling a laser cannon was to protect earth from the waves of alien invaders that we're coming down towards you from the top of the screen.

You had three lives but the game would end if the aliens managed to reach you and the bottom of the screen, you had to avoid shots fired by the aliens either by moving out of the way or hiding behind bunkers.

Special mention to the iconice sounds of Space Invaders, from the firing of the laser to a invader being evaperated after being successfully hit to the prominenet sound of the mystery ship, always accompanied by the continous basey beat which got faster and faster to add to the tension whilst playing the game.
