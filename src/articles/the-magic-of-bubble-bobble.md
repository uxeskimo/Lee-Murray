## Now it is the beginning of a fantastic story! 

It would of been between 1986 and 1989, me and my school mates would head to Sale swimming baths to cause mayhem and have fun in the pool.

The pool had a colour timing system, so your wristband would be a certain colour and there we're corresponding colour sirens.

When your colour Siren went off it was time to get out of the pool, but this was where the fun really started!

We'd get changed and be straight in the cafe to get some chips, the swimming baths had a canny way of making you hungry.

## Chips and arcades

It was the activity after bolting the chips down which was my favourite, playing or watching other people play the arcade in the swimming baths.

From memory in my time of going to the baths in that period, it had 5 arcade machines, these we're Pac Land, Double Dragon, Golden Axe, Robocop and the one that stood out above all, the magical Bubble Bobble.

It's catchy theme would draw you closer, I can still hear it clearly in my mind, the arcade cabinet had illustrations on the front of the main characters from the game Bub and Bob who both dragons.

It was a two player game, complete with two joysticks and corresponding push buttons, the 10p(?) coin slots had the red glow encouraging you to insert a coin and get started.

The aim of the game was to rescue Bub and Bobs girlfriends and in the process venture through the cave of monsters which consisted of over 100 levels and different caves.

Bub and Bob weren't you're normal fire breathing dragons, they fired out bubbles which would be directed at the many monsters that were in each platform level, once a monster was in a bubble you could then burst it to kill it.

Burst all the monsters in a level and you would move onto the next, along the way you could also collect various power ups, you had a time limit as well, the words 'Hurry up' would appear if you didn't meet it and everything got a bit quicker.

## What was the appeal of Bubble Bobble?

Bubble Bobble had charm, bucket loads, I've always been big on film and game scores, this one was so catchy, it was defo a big part of the charm for me.

It was also a classic two player game, it was better to play with someone else, it was fun and the pacing was good with the time time limits to make things get hectic.

The game was quirky as well, the character design was none offensive, the design was quite simple but worked well.

For your 10p(?) you could get a decent amount of play time out of it as well, it was addictive and the play was varied enough to keep you coming back.

As an initial post to get content on Retro Delights so we can get it live, it felt only right to do a one on Bubble Bobble, I've enjoyed going back to the 80's, to Sale swimming baths and the magic of Bubble Bobble.
