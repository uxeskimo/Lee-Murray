## Arcades in the 80's

The golden age of arcades for me was in the 80's, what a feeling going into a packed out arcade, the different iconic sounds playing over one an other, the detailed cabinet art, the lighting of the marquees and the attracter modes inviting you to come and spend you're coins.

## Dungeons and dragons inspiration

Guantlet was develped by Atari from the mind of [Ed Logg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Logg) and was relased in 1985, it was orginally to be titled Dungeons which was inspired by the Dungeos and Dragons board game, but to avoid legal issues Atari went for Guantlet instead.

The arcade was a four player cabinet, which at the time wansn't a common sight, you could choose from Thor the warrior, Merlin the wizard, Thyra the valkyrie and Questor the elf (you can see the influence from Dungeos and Dragons).

Each character had their strengths and weaknesses, my go to's would be Warrior or Wizard, it played like a shoot em up within a series of mazes, you had to find the exit to each level.

## Time not on your side

In each level youre characters health would be always counting down, so killing/avoiding enemies whilst looking for food and magic made Gauntlet a bit different to other arcades at the time, it was lots of fun.

## Sound snippets to die for, litrally

 You can't mention Guantlet without bringing up its sound, it had some classic soundbites, from the chime when you inserted a coin, to the sarcastic "Who shot the food" or the warning "Wizard is about to die", for more sounds from Guantlet have a listen at [Basements Arcade](https://www.basementarcade.com/Gaunlet.html).
